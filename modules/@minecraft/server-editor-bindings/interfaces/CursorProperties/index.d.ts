/**
 * The CursorProperties interface is used to describe the
 * properties of the Editor 3D block cursor construct.
 * The 3D block cursor can be queried to retrieve the current
 * properties, and the same property class can be used to set
 * the current properties of the cursor.
 * This interface is generally used at the activation stage of
 * the active tool to set up the color, visibility and input
 * properties of the 3D block cursor
